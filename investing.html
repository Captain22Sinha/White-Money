    <h1 class="text-6xl font-bold px-36 py-6">Investing</h1>
    <h1 class="text-2xl px-36 py-2">
      Investing differs from trading in that investing is for the long-term,
      usually years or decades. Investing is one of the key strategies to
      building long-term wealth and financial security.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold px-36 py-6">Stocks</h1>
    <h1 class="px-36">
      A stock represents a share of ownership in a company. When a company
      decides to raise capital by going public, it divides its ownership into
      shares, which are then sold to investors through an initial public
      offering (IPO). Investors who purchase these shares become shareholders
      and have a claim on the company's assets and earnings proportional to the
      number of shares they own. Stocks are typically traded on stock exchanges,
      such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or NASDAQ. Investors can buy
      and sell stocks on these exchanges, and the price of a stock is determined
      by supply and demand in the market. If a company performs well and is
      expected to generate higher profits in the future, the demand for its
      stock may increase, driving up its price. Conversely, negative news or
      poor performance can lead to a decrease in demand and a decline in the
      stock's price.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold px-36 py-6">Bonds</h1>
    <h1 class="px-36">
      Bonds are lower-risk and lower-return investments than stocks, which makes
      them an essential component of a balanced investment portfolio, especially
      for older or more conservative investors.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold px-36 py-6">Fixed Income</h1>
    <h1 class="px-36">
      Fixed income broadly refers to those types of investment security that pay
      investors fixed interest or dividend payments until their maturity date.
      At maturity, investors are repaid the principal amount they had invested.
      Government and corporate bonds are the most common types of fixed-income
      products. Unlike equities that may pay out no cash flows to investors, or
      variable-income securities, where payments can change based on some
      underlying measure—such as short-term interest rates—the payments of a
      fixed-income security are known in advance and remain fixed throughout.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold px-36 py-6">Mutual Funds</h1>
    <h1 class="px-36">
      A mutual fund is a type of investment vehicle that pools money from
      multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities,
      such as stocks, bonds, or other assets. It is managed by professional fund
      managers who make investment decisions on behalf of the investors.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold px-36 py-6">Option</h1>
    <h1 class="px-36">
      Option trading is a type of investment strategy that involves trading
      options contracts on an underlying security, such as stocks, bonds,
      commodities, or indices. Options are financial derivatives that provide
      the buyer (holder) with the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell
      the underlying asset at a predetermined price (strike price) within a
      specified period (expiration date).

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold px-36 py-6">Fundamental Analysis</h1>
    <h1 class="px-36">
      Fundamental analysis is one of the cornerstones of investing, and gives
      you tools to help determine the value of different investments. From SWOT
      analysis to PE ratios, learn the tools of fundamental analysis here.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold px-36 py-6">Technical Analysis</h1>
    <h1 class="px-36 pb-5">
      Technical analysis is the study of historical market data, including price
      and volume. Using insights from market psychology, behavioral economics,
      and quantitative analysis, technical analysts aim to use past performance
      to predict future market behavior. The two most common forms of technical
      analysis are chart patterns and technical (statistical) indicators.
